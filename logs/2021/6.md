### 14
*mon - pow/str*

```
- pm:
    - warmup exercises, lower body mobility
    - hard boulders, limit possibly, till no power/strength left; find compression moves
    - conditioning: trx TYIs, trx flys, fingerboard?
    - core + stretches (focus on lower body, groin as it hurts)
    
no expectations on the above, doing Pow/End on circuits before conditioning is good
as well, helps shred the binge
```

### 13 
*sun - pow*

```
- pm: pow
    - 15 minutes warmup exercises, 5xfailure (6-7) power pull ups, lower body mobility
    - 45-60ish minutes trying the new set
    - campus board: 1-3-5 / 1-4-5 / 1-4-6 (focus on pulling intensity, form, locking off)
    - stretches
    
had a great session, still not able to do 146 but now locking off the right arm on 145s
makes more sense and starts feeling natural; adding 124 to the mix next and 14s repeaters
also 1-3,4-5/6 (bump 3-4 then pull through); work on "roof pinches"?

nutrition: possibly due to dehydration, ended up eating loads
healthy at first (chicken breast, veggies, sweet potato) and snacked while boxing my meals
on rice and peas; evening had a diet coke with a friend, still dehydrated, went for chicken
kebab (poor choice #1) and out of control also ordered Â£20 worth of cheesecake and waffle;
arrived late, binged on it, all tasted terrible, bad texture, didn't enjoy it, feeling
bloated and possibly ate 3k cals in one day. Silly move
```

```
- pm: pow
    - 15-20 minutes warmup exercises + lower body mobility
    - 1-3,4-5 practice
    - core + stretches
    
not a good session, felt lethargic/tired as I walked into the gym; not pleased at all
possibly due to sleep/work/fuel or a combination of them all
quads/knees really sore
```

### 08
*tue -  rest*

```
- REST from climbing
- pm: max hangs + weighted pull ups at home (40 minutes)

  - set 2: +10kg
  - set 3, 4: +16kg
  
weighted pull ups (3 sets, 16kg): 6 reps, 8 reps, 8 reps

left ring finger still feeling tender a bit
current bodyweight (post morning poo, 10 hours after dinner): 58kg
16kg is 27.6% of my bodyweight, still not good enough (aiming for +40/45 added kgs, 80% bw)
```
