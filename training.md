### 321 macrocycle

| Phase | Length (weeks) | Training focus | Blocks |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | 3 | Low volume max strength & power training (anaerobic alactic focus) | 2-3x boulder/pow, 1-2x fun, 3x max fb, 2x conditioning |
| 2 | 2 | Moderate volume strength/power-endurance training (anaerobic lactic focus) | 2-3x pe/4x4, 1-2x fun, 3x repeater fb, 2x conditioning |
| 3 | 1 | Pre-trip taper / 3 - 7 days active recovery | cycle, 2-3x fun/volume, 3-5x light conditioning |
| _(optional)_ | _4_ | _ARC and aerobic conditioning_ | _3x arc, 1-2x fb, 1-2x conditioning_ |


```
Note: 
for on-season use a week-long microcycle
  - 2x days: stabilizer & antagonist training (submaximal "recovery", aerobic system focus - optional)
  - 1-2x days: climbing days, fun + either
     - low volume max strength & power training (anaerobic alactic focus)
     - strength/power-endurance training (anaerobic lactic focus)
  - 2 days of rest
ARC: add the 4-weeks phase first

Trying hard:
 High intensity training looks more like:
   1-3 move sequences on holds that are difficult for you to use.
   Short sequences or single moves that are body position and core intensive, requiring maximum full body effort to complete.  
   Short, heavy hangs on bad holds.
   Brief, explosive movements on the campus board, lasting no more than a few seconds.
 An easy way to gauge it all is that if you feel at all tired muscularly,
 but can still complete the exercise you've been doing,
 then it is far too middle to be  called high intensity.

### Fingerboard routines

| Block | Grips | Hang time | Pause | Reps | Sets | Rest |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| max | open hand, half crimp, front+back 3 | 5-8s | emom | 4-6 | 1x grip | 3+ minutes |
| repeater | open hand, 3f pockets, slopers | 7s | 3s | 6x grip | 1-3 sets | 2-3m reps, 10-12m sets |


```
Note:
- current max: 59kg bw + 25kg added
- target max: 95% bw (eg: +52kg added / one-hand hang w 3-5kg assistance)
- if no weights are available, take fingers off one hand, switch between reps
```

### Strength session

```
Focus is on forearm hypertrophy as well as strengthening the core, upper arms, shoulders, and back

  - Warm up by bouldering, finishing with a few difficult repeats 2-3 V grades below maximum
  - 60-90 minutes max bouldering (1-3 move sequences) or system board (1-3 move sequences)
    Focus is on static movement, lock-offs, pulling in underclings, etc..  Lots of rest between attempts
  - Hangboard. Maximum Weight hangs
  - Sport Specific Training. Pullups, rows, muscleups, dips, pushups, and hanging core work.
    Use rings/trx
  - Core + stabilizer work
```

### Power session

```
Focus is on explosive movement and muscle recruitment.

  - Warm up by bouldering, finishing with a few difficult repeats 2-3 V grades below maximum.
  - 45-60 minutes recruitment bouldering (3-5 move sequences) or same on the system board. 
    Focus is on big, powerful movement. Deadpoints.
    Opt for big moves that require tension to hold. Lots of rest between attempts.
  - Hangboard -> min edge hangs
  - Campus ~1hr, big movements and plyometrics.
  - Sport Specific Training. Only on days when not campusing.
  - Core + stabilizer work

Notes:
  - campus: 1-2 days per week only
```

### Strength/Power endurance session

```
  - Warm-up
    - 5-10m general mobility/stretch (duck walks, 4 points rotation)
    - Scapular pull ups + power pull ups emom
    - Boulder build up to limit
  - Power/strength-endurance bouldering
    - 4x4/6x3 AN-CAP 1 minute rest/rep, 3-4m rest/set (powered out, 75-80% max grade)
    - circuit single lap (for AERO-POW, double the lap) 1m rest/rep (1 rep = 1/2 laps), 10m rest/set, 5 sets
  - Finger flexor str/pow
    - repeaters / 1 arm / lock offs
    - campus AN-CAP (feet on campus board long moves + 1 boulder problem, 3-5 sets, appropriate rest)
  - Core + stabilizer work
 

Note:
  - prepare boulders for 4x4 before the phase starts
  - stop when power drops!!!
  - finger flexor work on alternate days
  - max 2x p/e sessions in a week (2 fun climbing days, power centric)
  - 1x week max hangs, 2x week repeaters
```

### Conditioning/antags session (little/no climbing)

```
  - Warm-up  (10m general mobility/stretch/pulse raisers) [optional: 30m light boulders]
  - Conditioning (b2b, 45-60s rest/set, 2m rest/giant set)
    - 3x12-15 bar shrugs
    - PUSH 3x8-12 trx tricep extensions + trx push ups + trx flys (no-equip: push ups/handstand push up)
    - PULL 3x8-12 trx rows + trx bicep pulls + p4x5 TWY (no-equip: rows/pull ups)
    - LEGS 3x8-12 trx one leg squat (each leg) (no-equip: air/pistol squat/lunges)
    - CORE 3x15-20 trx crunches + trx pike + side crucnches (no-equip: crunches/leg raises/knees-to-elbows/toe taps)
    - 3x3 each arm one hand lock off (3-5s)    
    - 3 sets of lizard/half-pidgeon poses, legs up the wall, 3x10 inner/outer rotation each arm

Note:
  - conditioning is very important, do 2x week
  - do 1 exercise per type after climbing sessions, for muscle balance, not strength/hypertrophy
  - lower body mobility extremely important, do 1 stretch + legs up the wall every day
