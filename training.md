- target max: 95% bw (eg: +52kg added / one-hand hang w 3-5kg assistance)
- if no weights are available, take fingers off one hand, switch between reps
```

### Strength/Power session
```
  - Warm-up
    - 5-10m general mobility/stretch (duck walks, 4 points rotation)
    - Scapular pull ups + power pull ups
    - Boulder build up to limit
  - Max/limit bouldering + pow
    - limit/1 grade within limit, 1m rest per move, 3+m rest per attempt, stop when power falters
    - campus (135/147, long reaches, bumps) 2sets each side, 2-3m rest
  - Finger flexor str/pow
    - max hangs / 1 arm / min edge / lock offs
  - Core + stabilizer work


Note:
  - high energy demands; low volume, high effort; come in well fueled try not heavy; hydrate
  - proper campus 2x week, fresh; 1x focus on woody, 1 on hard boulders (fun session)
  - steep and crimpy priority for strength
  - finger flexor work in the morning, train in the evening
  - skills to practice: boulder lock-offs, big moves on big holds, boulder campus
```

### Strength/Power endurance session
```
  - Warm-up
    - 5-10m general mobility/stretch (duck walks, 4 points rotation)
    - Scapular pull ups + power pull ups emom
    - Boulder build up to limit
  - Power/strength-endurance bouldering
    - 4x4/6x3 AN-CAP 1 minute rest/rep, 3-4m rest/set (powered out, 75-80% max grade)
    - circuit single lap (for AERO-POW, double the lap) 1m rest/rep (1 rep = 1/2 laps), 10m rest/set, 5 sets
  - Finger flexor str/pow
    - repeaters / 1 arm / lock offs
    - campus AN-CAP (feet on campus board long moves + 1 boulder problem, 3-5 sets, appropriate rest)
  - Core + stabilizer work
 

Note:
  - prepare boulders for 4x4 before the phase starts
  - stop when power drops!!!
  - finger flexor work on alternate days
  - max 2x p/e sessions in a week (2 fun climbing days, power centric)
  - 1x week max hangs, 2x week repeaters
```

### Conditioning/antags session (little/no climbing)
```
  - Warm-up  (10m general mobility/stretch/pulse raisers) [optional: 30m light boulders]

  - do 1 exercise per type after climbing sessions, for muscle balance, not strength/hypertrophy
  - lower body mobility extremely important, do 1 stretch + legs up the wall every day
